The primary purpose of the "Android Application for VU Blood Donation Society" is to provide a more efficient and automated system for managing blood donor and recipient information. Traditional blood donation systems rely on manual data entry, which can lead to outdated records, human errors, and delays in emergency situations. This application aims to overcome these limitations by offering a mobile platform that allows real-time access to verified donor data, filtered by blood group and location. It also includes essential factors such as age, gender, donation frequency, and last donation date, helping administrators manage the donor pool more effectively and ensure safe blood transfusions.
This Android application bridges the communication gap between donors and patients by using smart notifications, patient request visibility, and admin-managed approvals. Donors can register, view donation requests, and receive alerts tailored to their blood group and area. Patients can request blood, search for suitable donors, and track the status of their requests. Administrators play a central role in monitoring, approving, and managing users to ensure data integrity and system reliability. Overall, this software project contributes to society by promoting safe, accessible, and timely blood donation services through modern technology.
